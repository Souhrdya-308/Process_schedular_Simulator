🧠 Smart CPU Scheduler Simulator  
*A GUI-based CPU Scheduling Visualizer built with Python, Tkinter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.*

📘 Overview
The **Smart CPU Scheduler Simulator** is an interactive GUI tool that visualizes and compares popular CPU scheduling algorithms such as **FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin**.  
It provides real-time execution visualization, analytical dashboards, and energy efficiency modeling to help users understand scheduling behavior and performance metrics.

⚙️ Features
- Simulates **FCFS**, **SJF**, **Priority**, and **Round Robin** scheduling algorithms  
- Displays **real-time Gantt charts**, process timelines, and visual metrics  
- Calculates **waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time** with benchmark accuracy  
- Generates **performance reports** using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Models **CPU energy usage** (active, idle, and context-switch energy)  
- Simple, responsive **Tkinter GUI interface**

🧩 Tech Stack
- Language:** Python 3.10+  
- Frontend (GUI): Tkinter  
- Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas
